If you want to contribute, that's great! We need designers, programmers and everybody that want's us to add a new store.

To add a new store, simple head over to the [Physical Store](https://github.com/LilleJohs/UseNano.org/blob/master/public/physical.yml) or [Online Store](https://github.com/LilleJohs/UseNano.org/blob/master/public/merchants.yml) yaml file and fill in the required information. Make sure that every new listing has all the fields filled out. Put logos in the [Logo](https://github.com/LilleJohs/UseNano.org/tree/master/client/public/logos) folder. If you have no logo for the store, just enter 'none.png' as logo. For website links, remember to add 'http://' or 'https://'.

You can also send me a message on Reddit [u/LilleJohs](https://www.reddit.com/user/LilleJohs) or send an email to spendnano@gmail.com
